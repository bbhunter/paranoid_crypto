  are indistinguishable from random data).
  The method here computes s = -sum(math.log(p) for p in pvalues) and returns
  the probability that a list of uniformly distributed p-values results in a
  larger sum. This method was proposed by Fisher in 1934.

  If the p-values are uniformly distributed (as they ideally should)
  then the value s = -sum(math.log(p) for p in pvalues) has an Erlang
  distribution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution.
  The survival function of the Erlang distribution with rate 1 is a special
  case of Igamc.

  Different proposals to combine p-values are compared in the paper
  "Choosing Between Methods of Combining p-values" by N. A. Heard and
  P. Rubin-Delanchy, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06897.pdf .

  A criterion used here is that the method should be sensitive to small
  p-values. A pseudo random number generator that sometimes generates weak
