def univariate_modp(f: sympy.Poly, b: int, k: int = 3) -> Optional[int]:
  """Returns a small root of a univariate polynomial modulo an unknown factor.

  For a composite n, given a polynomial f(x) = 0 mod p, where p is an unknown
  factor of n, this function applies Coppersmith/Howgrave-Graham method to find
  a small root of f. The expected root should be smaller than the bound b. This
  function assumes that n is a balanced RSA modulus, i.e., n = p*q, where p and
  q have equal bit-lengths (beta = 1/2 by original Coppersmith method).

  E.g., for a polynomial f(x) = p0 + x and by using k = 2 the generated lattice
  has the triangular form:
  | n^2       0        0       0  |
  | n*p0     n*b       0       0  |
  | p0^2    2*p0*b    b^2      0  |
  |  0      p0^2*b  2*p0*b^2  b^3 |

  I.e., every new polynomial is a multiple of p and introduces exactly one new
  monomial to the lattice. The size of this lattice might be good enough for
  some situations but in order to achieve better results for a larger bound b,
  one can use a larger value of k. The maximum bound possible should be about
  half of the size of p, according to Howgrave-Graham theorem.

  Args:
    f: Univariate polynomial modulus n. This polynomial has to be 0 when mod p,
      where p is a factor of n.
    b: The maximum value of the expected root.
    k: A value that determines the size of the lattice. The dimension of the
      lattice is 2*k*d, where d is the degree of f.

  Returns:
    a small -b < root < b for the polynomial f if found, None otherwise.

  """Returns small roots of a multivariate polynomial modulo an unknown factor.

  Proposal of M. Herrmann and A. May., 'Solving Linear Equations Modulo
  Divisors: On Factoring Given Any Bits', ASIACRYPT 2008. For a composite n,
  given a polynomial f = 0 mod p, where p is an unknown factor of n, this
  function applies Herrmann & May  method to find small roots of f. f has to be
  a linear equation f(x1, x2, ..., xl) = a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... + al*xl.
  The expected roots should be smaller than the bounds. This function assumes
  that n is a balanced RSA modulus, i.e., n = p*q, where p and q have equal
  bit-lengths (beta = 1/2).

  The generated polynomials for the lattice are of the form
  g_i2,...,il,k = x2^i2 * x3^i3 * ... * xn^in * f^k * N^max{t-k, 0}, for an
  optimized t value, 0 <= k <= m, ij in {0...m} and sum(ij) <= m-k.
  I.e., every new polynomial is a multiple of p and introduces exactly one new
  monomial to the lattice. In order to achieve better results for larger bounds,
  one can use a larger value of m. The maximum product of bounds possible
  should be about n^0.25, according to Howgrave-Graham theorem. However, as
  discussed by Herrmann and May, with more unknowns it is natural to achieve
  smaller bounds. E.g., with two balanced unknowns, the product of the bounds
  is about n^0.207.

  E.g., for a polynomial f(x1, x2) = a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2, the generated lattice
  has the triangular form:

  """Returns small roots of a multivariate polynomial modulo an integer.

  Proposal of E. Jochemsz and A. May., 'A Strategy for Finding Roots of
  Multivariate Polynomials with New Applications in Attacking RSA Variants',
  ASIACRYPT 2006. Given a polynomial f = 0 mod n, this function applies Jochemsz
  & May method to find small roots of f. f can be any polynomial with arbitrary
  degree. The expected roots should be smaller than the bounds.

  Compared to univariate_modp and multivariate_modp, this function is more
  appropriate to be used on vulnerabilities where the product of factors of n
  generate properties (e.g., unknowns) that do not exist or do not have enough
  information on the individual factors.

  First it defines the set of monomials:
  m_k = {x1^i1 * x2^i2 * ... * xn^in |
         x1^i1 * x2^i2 * ... * xn^in is a monomial of f^m and
        (x1^i1 * x2^i2 * ... * xn^in)/l^k is a monomial of f^(m-k)},
  where l is the leading monomial of f and 0 <= k <= m+1.
  Thus, the generated polynomials for the lattice are of the form
  g_i1,...,in,k = ((x1^i1 * x2^i2 * ... * xn^in)/l^k) * f^k * N^(m-k), for
  0 <= k <= m and x1^i1 * x2^i2 * ... * xn^in is an element of the set

  bounds possible should be about n^0.5. However, with more unknowns it is
  natural to achieve smaller bounds.
