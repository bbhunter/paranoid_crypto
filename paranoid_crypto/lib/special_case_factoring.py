def FactorWithGuess(n: int, p_0: int) -> Optional[list[int]]:
  """Tries to factor an RSA modulus n given an approximation p_0 of p.

  The method finds a factorization if p_0 is close enough to a factor p
  of n. It is somewhat tricky to define when an approximation is close enough.
  Typically when the guess p_0 has about the same size as the square root of n
  then a difference abs(p - p_0) up to about 1 / 6 of the bit size of n is
  sufficiently close. If p / q can be approximated by a fraction with small
  numerator and denominator then a difference up to about 1 / 4 of the bit
  size of n is sufficient.

  This implementation is based on a method by Lehman proposed in the paper
  "Factoring large integers", Math. Comp. 28:637-646. (See also
  Section 5.1.2 of "Prime numbers, a computational perspective" 2nd ed.,
  by Crandall and Pomerance.)

  The motivation for this implementation is the paper
  "Factoring RSA keys from certified smart cards: Coppersmith in the wild"
  https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf
  Appendix A of this paper contains a list of prime factors of weak RSA
  moduli found in the wild. A number of these prime factors have a pattern
  that is easy to guess, except for the last few bits.

  Coppersmith has proposed an algorithm that can factor RSA keys with weaker
  guesses, (i.e. for an 2048-bit RSA key it could recover up to 512 bits of
  a factor p, given the 512 most significant bits of p.)
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith_method
  This method, however requires much more CPU time and it is unclear if it
  would give much better results. Coppersmith's method requires an
  implementation of the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz lattice basis reduction
  algorithm. This is somewhat tricky to implement efficiently. Hence this is
  something that might be attempted using sagemath.

  Args:
    n: an RSA modulus
    p_0: a guess for a factor p

    A factorization [p, q] of n or None if no factor could be found.
