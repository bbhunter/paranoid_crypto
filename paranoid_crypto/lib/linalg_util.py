def echelon_form(a: list[list[int]], b: Optional[list[int]] = None) -> int:
  """Puts the matrix of integers a in row echelon form.

  All the operations are over the integers. Only exact divisions are performed.
  Thus, this function is useful when working over the integers.

  This is an adapted implementation of the proposal of Peter R. Turner,
  'A Simplified Fraction-Free Integer Gauss Elimination Algorithm', U. S. Naval
  Academy, 1995. The difference is that the original algorithm doesn't perform
  row swapping to the bottom when linear dependent rows are found, and fails
  when encounters zero pivots.

  It is interesting to note that the last element of the matrix in echelon form
  through this algorithm is the determinat of the original matrix.

  In order to work with Integers only, comparing with original gaussian
  elimination, it requires twice multiplications and divisions are increased
  from O(n^2) to O(n^3). The author, however, shows that working with Rationals
  wouldn't provide any improvement, and would require additional GCD
  computations.

  The b parameter can be provided for the useful cases when solving a linear
  system. I.e., it will be equivalent of performing gaussian elimination on the
  augmented matrix a||b.

  The changes on a and b are in place. Thus, if one wants to preserve the
  original a and b, one should pass copies of them to this function. The return
  value is the rank of the matrix a.

  Args:
    a: matrix of integers with m rows and n columns, with m >= n.
    b: optional vector of integers of size m. Useful when solving a system.

  Returns:
    rank of a.
